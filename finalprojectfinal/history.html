                <h3>The Beginnings of VR</h3>
                <p>Although commercial VR has only come to prominence in the past decade or so, the concept itself has existed for over 80 years. </p>
                <p>In 1938, French playwright Antonin Artaud wrote a series of essays referring to illusory characters and objects in the field of theater as “la realite virtuelle,” or “the virtual reality, marking the first use of the term. Ivan Sutherland was the first one to propose a concept that resembles our modern idea of virtual reality, in his essay called “The Ultimate Display.” </p>
                <p>Published in 1965, the essay proposed a concept for a display that conveys information to all the senses, which would be stimulated by a computer to form an artificial experience. In order to create such a display, he envisioned a number of technologies, including devices such as 3D display systems and eye tracking (Berg & Vance, 2016). However, since Sutherland’s vision was ahead of its time, it would still take nearly 30 years before it would begin to be fully realized.</p>

                <h3><br><br>The Rise of VR Technology</h3>
                <p>VR technology would gradually progress throughout the 70s and into the 80s. </p>
                <p>During the 1980s, the technology would be utilized by NASA on various projects alongside other forms of human-computer interaction (Bushey, 2017). In addition, the first commercial VR company, VPL research, would be founded durin this period. However, the 90s saw exponential growth in the field of VR.</p>
                <p>In 1993, John A. Adam published an article called “Virtual Reality is For Real.” In this article, Adam described the use of VR at several major companies and prominent universities and determined that even though there was still more work to be done, the technology “almost works” and has the potential to create many immersive experiences (Berg & Vance, 2016). VR technology continued to further improve throughout the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s, eventually turning from an expensive commodity into a household item.</p>

                <h3><br>The Age of Commercial VR</h3>
                <p>In the late 2010s and early 2020s, virtual reality is at an all-time peak, and can be found in many households across the world.</p>
                <p>The most common use for VR in today&#39;s world is for video games. Using specially designed VR consoles, gamers can fully immerse themselves in the games they play. Unlike conventional video games, which are limited by what you can see on a screen, virtual reality games allow the user to be fully immersed in the experience.</p>
                <p>These modern VR headsets utilize motion tracking, with a display that moves when the user turns their head, and with controls integrated into the user’s arm and hand movements. These systems allow the user to be fully immersed in the experience.</p></p>
