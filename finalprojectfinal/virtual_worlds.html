                <h3>A Whole New World</h3>
                <p>With the advancement of VR technology, the concept of completely digital worlds has emerged.</p>
                <p>These worlds can be as small as a single room, or as large as entire cities. They can be recreations or entirely unique creations. And with a diversity of virtual worlds, comes a diversity of their purpose. One such example is virtual tourism.</p>
                <p>By playing a fully immersive, 360 degree video into the headset, along with the associated sounds, a person can feel like they&#39;re standing in the streets of Paris or at the summit of Mount Fuji or on a beach in the South Pacific, all without stepping foot outside your house. Interactive displays allow one to “walk” up to the various shops and locales of such faraway lands, creating a truly immersive experience. Such experiences allow users to experience places they would otherwise never go, or have a dry run before they start planning a vacation to “try before they buy.” (Yadav, 2021).</p>

                <h3><br><br><br>The Practical Impact of Virtual Worlds</h3>
                <p>Virtual worlds can be used for more than just personal pleasure however. 
                <p>Virtual simulation can be used for a variety of purposes, including environmental conservation. For instance, at a VR laboratory in Idaho National Laboratories, lidar data (light + radar data) is loaded up into a CAVE (Cave Automatic Visual Environment) virtual reality simulator. The virtual reality system causes the inputted data to spring to life, creating a layout of the landscape.</p>
                <p>Using color-coded dots, the same landscape is displayed twice, at different points in time. This technology can be used to easily detect visual changes in the landscape over time, and figure out environmental causes to those changes (Berg and Vance, 2016).</p>

                <h3>The Metaverse</h3>
                <p>Spearheading the development of new and exciting virtual worlds is the concept of the Metaverse.</p>
                <p>First coined in the science fiction novel “Snow Crash,” the metaverse is essentially a digital world all of its own. People were represented by their own virtual avatars and digital currency was used to buy clothes and other items. People could group up, play games, hang out with friends, or just wander around with no interest in mind. The Metaverse is often considered a step up from the internet, a place where people don&#39;t just “browse,” they “live.”</p> 
                <p>Although often the topic of science fiction, there are substantial efforts to make such a world a reality. In 2021, the social media company Facebook rebranded itself as Meta, as they announced their shifting focus from social media into developing their own version of the Metaverse. At the same time, the company announced plans to spend $10 billion to develop the technology needed to create such a universe (Needle, 2022). Only time will tell if their efforts are successful, but if they are, the existence of a digital reality will forever change the way we live in the physical reality.</p>
