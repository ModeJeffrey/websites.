                <h3>VR in the Classroom</h3>

                <p>Another emerging faucet of virtual reality is the use of virtual reality in education.</p>
                <p> As VR continues to become an ever-growing faucet of our life, education is no different. VR has many properties that help aid in the educational process. Perhaps chief among them is student engagement. For many years, teachers have struggled to keep their students engaged and focused in their material, trying many different methods but often to no avail. Virtual reality provides a solution to this problem.</p>
                <p> A study performed on 57 students from the Western US found that students who participated in a VR biology exercise demonstrating the workings of the human bloodstream found that students participating in the VR experience reported improved levels. Another study conducted with a group of middle school children showcased a higher group score in those who were instructed in VR than those who were instructed with more traditional education methods (Raja & Priya, 2021).</p>

                <h3><br><br>A Risk-Free Training Environment</h3>
                <p>VR also provides a safe outlet for practicing and training skills that are otherwise physically dangerous or highly complex.</p>
                <p>For instance, VR let's trainee surgeons hone their skills in a safe and controlled way. A VR environment allows these surgeons to go through the motions of performing a delicate operation, but alleviates the risk of grievously harming the patient if a motion is done incorrectly. </p>
                <p>This method has also been adopted by corporations as a way to train their employees, as Wal-Mart has 17,000 Oculus Go headsets for training their customer service employees (Yadav, 2021).  Such methods need to be further researched before their full benefits may be assessed, but this approach could help alleviate many of the issues that come with training people in highly skilled and specialized fields.</p>

                <h3>Drawbacks of Educational VR</h3>
                <p>Even with all the benefits of using VR for educational purposes, they are not without their drawbacks. </p>
                <p>Perhaps the biggest drawback is cost; VR headsets are expensive, so a large sum of money must be spent to convert a standard education laboratory into a VR one, a cost only affordable to private institutions paid for by shareholders.</p>
                <p>Prolonged use of VR devices may also result in motion sickness and visual fatigue, with students reporting symptoms like fatigue, nausea, and dizziness (Raja & Priya, 2021). However, as VR technology continues to advance, perhaps these shortcomings may be alleviated.</p>
