                <h3>New Technologies</h3>
                <p>In the past six years, we have experienced many breakthroughs in virtual reality technology that have changed the way the medium works.</p>
                <p>For instance, in an attempt to alleviate the discomfort often experienced as a result of prolonged VR use, companies such as Avegant and Magic Leap have developed a technology known as focus tunable displays, which use light field cameras, special types of cameras that can re-focus pictures after they’re taken to project content in multiple focal claims. </p>
                <p>Efforts have also been made to merge VR and AR (augmented reality) into one singular all-inclusive device. Intel introduced a device called Project Alloy at it’s August 2016 Developer’s Conference, where the company called it “an all-in-one virtual reality solution made from the ground up.” (Bushey, 2017).</p>

            <h3><br><br>Problems and Solutions</h3>
            <img src="images/pincushiondistortion.png" alt="Example of pincushion distortion.">
            <p>Alongside many improvements in VR technology, new methods are being developed to circumvent many of the problems that still persist with VR technology. </p>
            <p>One such issue is pincushion distortion. In the early days of VR headsets, due to the curved lenses of VR headsets, attempting to view an otherwise flat image in a VR headset caused the image to distort inwards. This is known as pincushion distortion.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to get around pincushion distortion, VR software developers have begun to use images that are already distorted with pincushion distortion, so when they’re distorted by the lenses, the image displays as normal (Anthes et al, 2016). </p>
            <p>Although just one example, VR developers are constantly looking for new ways to iron out problems, be they hardware or software-related.</p>

                <h3><br>The Competitive Market and VR</h3>
                <p>Just like all technologies, healthy competition has helped nurture the developments of VR technologies.</p>
                <p>When the Oculus Rift was first released back in 2012, it was essentially a prototype in an emerging market. The Rift relied on two stationary sensors attached to the PC, and would cease to work if one wandered too far from their sensors. However, as time went on, the market for such devices increased, and new players began to enter the market. </p>
                <p>In 2016, HTC released their Vive headset, which contained room-size tracking sensors built into the headset, eliminating the need for external sensors. In 2019, Oculus released their new headset, the Oculus Quest, which not only featured 6 degrees of freedom and touch controllers, but also integrated the sensors into the headset (Raja & Priya, 2021).</p>
